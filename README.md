# CMSC_201_Python_List_Processing_Projects
The proj1.py program is an automated version of the algorithm Conway's Game of Life, complete with a test library of pre-built board patterns and a menu interface. It reads patterns from text files found in the board_patterns_proj1 directory. Boards are printed in blue unicode dots and also shown in pure list format when the program is run in a terminal.

The proj2.py program is designed to autofill empty spaces in a 2D board (a nested list) recursively with a provided character, the results of which are shown in terminal. The board itself is read in from a text file and is converted to a 2D list for processing. Each step of the recursion can be shown if that option is selected during runtime.
